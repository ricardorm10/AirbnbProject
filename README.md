# Airbnb Database Filter README
## Project Overview
This project is a filter designed to streamline the process of searching for properties within the Airbnb database. It simplifies the task of finding properties with specific characteristics, allowing users to narrow down their search based on various parameters. This README file provides a comprehensive guide on how to use this filter effectively.

## Filter Parameters
The filter includes the following parameters to refine your property search:

1. **Borough:** This parameter refers to the different boroughs or administrative divisions within a city where the properties are located.
1. **Neighbourhood:** Neighbourhoods are specific areas within a borough. Users can choose a neighbourhood to focus their search on.
1. **Type:** This parameter allows users to specify the type of property they are interested in, such as apartments, houses, or other accommodation types.
1. **Min Price:** The minimum price per night that a customer is willing to pay for the selected property.
1. **Max Price:** The maximum price per night that a customer is willing to pay for the selected property.

## Parameter Definitions
To provide a better understanding of the parameters:

1. **Borough and Neighbourhood:** These parameters help users pinpoint the exact location of the property within the city. Boroughs are broader geographical divisions, while neighbourhoods offer more specific locations within a borough.
1. **Type:** This parameter enables users to filter properties based on their preferred accommodation type, whether it's an apartment, house, or another type of lodging.
1. **Min Price and Max Price:** These parameters allow users to set a price range for their stay. The minimum and maximum prices define the budget constraints within which the filter will search for properties.

## Error Handling
The filter is designed to provide specific responses in the following scenarios:

1. **Invalid Parameters:** If any of the parameters provided are incorrect or not recognized, the filter will return an error message indicating that the parameters need to be reviewed.
1. **No Parameters Provided:** If the search is executed without specifying any parameters, the filter will prompt the user to enter at least one parameter to initiate a meaningful search.

## Search Results
Once the filter has been configured with the desired parameters, it will return a list of properties that meet the specified criteria. The filter is designed to be flexible, allowing users to combine and adjust parameters to find properties that match their preferences accurately.
